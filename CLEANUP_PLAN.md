## üóÇÔ∏è Recommended File Organization

After cleanup, create a `scripts/` directory to organize remaining utilities:

```
scripts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data-ingestion/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ingest_docx.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt (renamed from requirements-ingest.txt)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scraping/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scraper_prototype.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt (renamed from requirements-scraper.txt)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ maintenance/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analyze_duplicates.py (renamed from analyze_duplicates_v3.py)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate_cleanup_plan.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ execute_cleanup.py
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Before Deleting

**IMPORTANT:** Before executing the cleanup:

1. ‚úÖ **Ensure the latest duplicate cleanup was successful** (verified - 0 duplicates remaining)
2. ‚úÖ **Verify the database is in good state**
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Create a git commit** before deleting files:
   ```powershell
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Pre-cleanup snapshot"
   ```
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Optionally archive deleted files** to a separate location:
   ```powershell
   mkdir archived_files
   # Move files there instead of deleting
   ```

---

## üöÄ Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Backup
```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "Pre-cleanup snapshot - preserving all files before major cleanup"
```

### Phase 2: Delete Temporary Files
Remove all JSON/HTML analysis and debug files.

### Phase 3: Delete Obsolete Scripts
Remove all one-off, test, and verification scripts.

### Phase 4: Reorganize Utilities
Move remaining utility scripts to `scripts/` directory.

### Phase 5: Update Documentation
Update README.md to reflect new structure.

### Phase 6: Final Commit
```powershell
git add -A
git commit -m "Major cleanup: removed 74 obsolete files, reorganized utilities"
```

## üìù Notes

- The cleanup will remove **74 files** totaling several MB
- All removed files were either:
  - One-time operations already completed
  - Temporary analysis/debug output
  - Superseded by newer versions
  - Test files for completed features
- No production code or active utilities will be removed
- The project will be significantly cleaner and easier to navigate
