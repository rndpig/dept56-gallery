"""
Diagnostic script to find items that are in the wrong table based on their relationships.

Logic:
1. Find "houses" that are linked to accessories whose names match actual houses
   (This suggests the "house" is actually an accessory)

2. Find "accessories" that have links where the linked item name matches a house
   (This suggests the "accessory" is actually a house)

3. Find items in wrong tables based on relationship inversions
