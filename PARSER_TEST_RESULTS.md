## Overall Parser Performance

### ✅ Working Perfectly:
1. **Canonical accessory names** - Using line 2 from page 1 correctly
2. **Reciprocal linking** - 1:1 house↔accessory links working
3. **SKU extraction** - Handles "SKU:", "Item #", and direct format (56.12345)
4. **Price extraction** - Correctly identifies prices with $ symbol
5. **Description extraction** - Finds first substantial sentence
6. **Name matching** - Correctly identifies section boundaries

### ⚠️ Areas for Improvement:
1. **Year extraction** - Struggles with "December, 2006" format (gets month instead of year)
2. **Sparse documents** - Some older documents have minimal data (1996 era)
3. **Missing fields** - Some documents simply don't contain all fields

### 📊 Success Rate:
- **Documents Parsed:** 3/3 (100%)
- **Critical Fields (Names, Links):** 3/3 (100%)
- **Optional Fields (SKU, Price, Year):** Varies by document quality

## Parser Features Validated

### Core Functionality:
- ✅ Extracts house name from line 1
- ✅ Extracts accessory name from line 2
- ✅ Skips "Box" lines automatically
- ✅ Finds section boundaries intelligently
- ✅ Creates reciprocal links (1:1 relationship)
- ✅ Handles multiple SKU formats

---

## Next Steps

1. **Recommended:** Test on 5-10 more documents to validate consistency
2. **Optional:** Improve year extraction for "Month, Year" formats
3. **Future:** Add image extraction support
4. **Ready:** Parser is ready for batch processing once validated

---

## Conclusion

The parser is **working very well** with the core functionality validated:
- ✅ Correctly extracts house and accessory names
- ✅ Maintains 1:1 reciprocal links
- ✅ Handles most common field formats
- ⚠️ Some documents naturally have sparse data (especially older ones)

The parser successfully handles the variability in Word document formatting and correctly implements the requested features (canonical names and reciprocal linking).
