# üöÄ Ready for Production Deployment

## Summary

All code is ready! Here's what has been prepared:

### ‚úÖ Parser Enhancements Complete
- **Text Extraction**: SKU, description, price, year, retired_year, purchased_year, collection, series
- **Multi-Accessory Support**: Handles houses with 2+ accessories
- **Image Extraction**: Extracts house and accessory images from Word documents
- **5+ Document Formats**: Traditional, "Accessories-...", "No ACC box", "Set of X", multi-accessory

### ‚úÖ Database Migrations Ready
- `migration_add_all_fields.sql` - Adds all new fields to houses and accessories tables
- `clear_database.sql` - Safely clears all existing data

### ‚úÖ Batch Processing Script Ready
- `scripts/batch_process.py` - Parses all documents and uploads to Supabase
- Uses service role key to bypass RLS
- Creates house-accessory links automatically
- Generates consolidated JSON and summary reports

## üéØ Quick Start Deployment

### Option 1: Manual Steps (Recommended for First Time)

#### 1. Apply Database Migration
Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query

Paste and run the entire contents of:
```
migration_add_all_fields.sql
```

#### 2. Clear Existing Data
In Supabase SQL Editor, paste and run:
```
clear_database.sql
```

Verify all tables are empty by running the verification query at the bottom.

#### 3. Run Batch Processor
In PowerShell:
```powershell
cd "C:\Users\rndpi\Documents\Coding Projects\Dept 56 gallery app"

python scripts\batch_process.py "\\DilgerNAS\Public\Media\Day NP Files"
```

This will:
- Parse all ~100 Word documents
- Extract text and images
- Upload houses and accessories to Supabase
- Create house-accessory links
- Save results to `parsed_output/`

#### 4. Verify Upload
Check Supabase dashboard or run in SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT 'houses' as table, COUNT(*) as count FROM houses
UNION ALL SELECT 'accessories', COUNT(*) FROM accessories
UNION ALL SELECT 'links', COUNT(*) FROM house_accessory_links;
```

### Option 2: Automated Script
```powershell
.\deploy.ps1
```

This will guide you through each step interactively.

## üìä Expected Results

- **Houses**: ~100 (one per document)
- **Accessories**: ~100-150 (varies, some houses have 2+ accessories)
- **Links**: ~100-150 (house-accessory relationships)
- **Images**: ~200-300 extracted to `parsed_output/images/`

## üìù Files Created

### SQL Migrations
- `migration_add_all_fields.sql` - Comprehensive field additions
- `clear_database.sql` - Safe data clearing

### Python Scripts
- `scripts/batch_process.py` - Main batch processor
- `scripts/docx_parser_simple.py` - Enhanced parser with image extraction
- `scripts/get_user_id.py` - Utility to get Supabase user ID
- `scripts/run_migration.py` - Migration helper

### Documentation
- `PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Detailed deployment guide
- `DEPLOYMENT_READY.md` - This file

### Configuration
- `.env` - Updated with SUPABASE_USER_ID

## üîß Configuration

All credentials are already in `.env`:
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
- ‚úÖ `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_USER_ID`
- ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_USER_EMAIL`
- ‚úÖ `SUPABASE_USER_PASSWORD`

## üé® Image Upload (Post-Processing)

The batch processor extracts images to `parsed_output/images/` but doesn't upload them to Supabase Storage yet.

### Manual Upload:
1. Go to Supabase Storage ‚Üí `dept56-images` bucket
2. Create folder: `6de5a570-e513-480e-a767-d99df14785d5` (your user ID)
3. Upload all images from `parsed_output/images/`

### Automated Upload (Future):
We can create a separate script to:
- Upload images to Supabase Storage
- Update `photo_url` fields in database
- Handle image optimization/resizing

## üß™ Testing

Before full deployment, you can test on a few documents:

```powershell
# Test single document
python scripts\docx_parser_simple.py "\\DilgerNAS\Public\Media\Day NP Files\Frosty Pines Outfitters 2002 Ready for Adventure.docx"

# Test batch with --parse-only (skip upload)
python scripts\batch_process.py "\\DilgerNAS\Public\Media\Day NP Files" --parse-only
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Backup First**: Make sure you have a backup of any important data before clearing the database

2. **RLS Policies**: The batch processor uses the service role key which bypasses RLS. This is intentional for bulk imports.

3. **Image Storage**: Images are extracted locally but not yet uploaded to Supabase Storage. This is a manual step for now.

4. **Duplicates**: If you run the batch processor multiple times without clearing the database, you'll get duplicate entries.

5. **Error Handling**: The batch processor continues even if individual documents fail. Check `upload_summary.json` for errors.

## üìö Post-Deployment Tasks

After successful deployment:

1. ‚úÖ Verify data in Supabase dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Upload images to Supabase Storage
3. ‚úÖ Update UI to display new fields (SKU, price, retired_year, collection, series)
4. ‚úÖ Add filtering/sorting by new fields
5. ‚úÖ Test the application end-to-end

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "No module named 'supabase'"
```powershell
pip install supabase python-dotenv
```

### "No module named 'docx'"
```powershell
pip install python-docx
```

### "Permission denied" errors
- Make sure you're using the service role key (check .env)
- Verify RLS policies in Supabase

### Database not clearing
- Make sure you ran `clear_database.sql` in the SQL Editor
- Check for foreign key constraint errors

### Parser errors
- Check `parsed_output/consolidated_results.json` for specific errors
- Review problematic documents manually
- Some documents may have unusual formatting

## üéâ Ready to Deploy!

Everything is prepared and tested. You can proceed with deployment whenever you're ready!

**Estimated Time**: 5-10 minutes for full deployment (depending on document count and network speed)

**Last Updated**: October 18, 2025
