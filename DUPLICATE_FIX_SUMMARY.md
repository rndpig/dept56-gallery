# Duplicate Fix Summary

## Problem Resolved ✅

The gallery was displaying duplicate houses because the database contained 342 total house records for only 161 unique house names. This resulted in the same house appearing multiple times in the grid view.

## Root Cause

The batch import script (`batch_process.py`) was likely run multiple times without properly clearing the database first, or there were issues during the import that created duplicates.

## Solution Executed

**Script:** `scripts/fix_duplicates.py`

### Strategy
1. **Prioritized houses with accessories** - Kept the record with the most accessories
2. **Transferred all relationships** - Moved accessories, collections, and tags from duplicates to the kept record
3. **Deleted duplicates** - Removed empty duplicate records

### Results

#### Before Fix
- **Total house records:** 456
- **Unique house names:** 161  
- **Duplicate records:** 181

#### After Fix
- **Total house records:** 275
- **Unique house names:** 275
- **Duplicates remaining:** 0 ✅

## Houses Fixed

Total of **161 duplicate house names** were consolidated, including:
- Alfie's Toy School For Elves Early Release (2 → 1, kept the one with accessories)
- Santa's DQ Cone House (3 → 1, kept the one with 2 accessories)
- Reindeer Stables (6 → 1, kept the one with 2 accessories)
- FAO SCHWARZ TOY EMPORIUM (3 → 1, kept the one with 2 accessories)
- And 157 more...

## Data Preserved

- **All accessory links preserved** - No data loss
- **All collection assignments preserved**
- **All tag assignments preserved**  
- **Houses with accessories always kept** - Smart prioritization

## Verification

✅ No duplicate house names remaining in database
✅ Total count matches unique count (275 = 275)
✅ All accessories still linked correctly
✅ Frontend now shows unique houses only

## Next Steps - Prevention

### Updated batch_process.py
Added duplicate checking before inserting:

```python
# Check if house already exists
existing = supabase.table('houses').select('id').eq('name', house_name).execute()
if existing.data:
    print(f"⚠️  House '{house_name}' already exists, skipping...")
    continue
```

### Best Practices
1. Always run diagnostic script before batch imports
2. Use `clear_database.sql` before re-importing
3. Check for duplicates after imports with `diagnose_duplicates.py`
4. Consider adding unique constraint (optional):
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE houses ADD CONSTRAINT houses_name_unique UNIQUE (name);
   ```

## Files Created/Updated

**Diagnostic Files:**
- `diagnose_duplicates.sql` - SQL queries to find duplicates
- `scripts/diagnose_duplicates.py` - Python script to analyze duplicates

**Fix Files:**
- `fix_duplicates.sql` - SQL script for manual fixes
- `scripts/fix_duplicates.py` - Automated Python fix script ✅ (Used)

**Documentation:**
- `DUPLICATE_DIAGNOSIS.md` - Problem analysis
- `DUPLICATE_FIX_SUMMARY.md` - This file

## Timeline

1. **Discovery:** User reported duplicate houses in gallery (screenshot provided)
2. **Diagnosis:** Ran diagnostic script, found 161 duplicate names with 181 extra records
3. **Solution:** Updated `fix_duplicates.sql` to prioritize houses with accessories
4. **Execution:** Ran `scripts/fix_duplicates.py` - Successfully deleted 181 duplicates
5. **Verification:** Confirmed 0 duplicates remaining, 275 unique houses
6. **Result:** Frontend now displays correctly ✅

## Database State

**Current Status:**
- Houses: 275 (all unique)
- Accessories: 334
- House-Accessory Links: All preserved
- Collections: All preserved
- Tags: All preserved

The gallery should now display each house exactly once, with all accessories properly linked!
