## 🎯 Items Without Images

### Houses Missing Images (26)
Some houses don't have images in their Word documents. These can be added manually later or may not have images in the source documents.

### Accessories Missing Images (68)
Some accessories don't have separate images (they may share the house image or be text-only entries).

### Common Reasons for Missing Images
1. **No image in document** - Some Word docs only have text
2. **Name mismatches** - Special characters or punctuation differences
3. **Set contents** - Items extracted from "Set of X" lists without individual images
4. **Accessories-only lines** - Brief mentions without detailed sections
