2. Build the new version
3. Deploy to production automatically
4. Send you a notification

**This just happened!** Check your Vercel dashboard to see the deployment.

## For Future Reference

### If You Need to Make Changes:
1. Edit files locally
2. Test with `npm run dev`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Your message"`
4. Push: `git push origin main`
5. Vercel auto-deploys in ~2 minutes

### If You Need to Add More Admin Users:
1. Edit `src/DeptApp.tsx`
2. Add email to `ALLOWED_ADMIN_EMAILS` array
3. Commit and push
4. They'll have access next time they sign in

### If You Need to Re-import Data:
- All scripts are still in `scripts/` directory
