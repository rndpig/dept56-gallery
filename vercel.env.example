# DO NOT commit real secrets. Use the Vercel dashboard to set production/preview env vars.

# Service role key (server-side only) - NEVER commit this file with a real key

# Optional deployment helpers

# Note:
# 1) If you find a file in your git history that exposes a service role key, rotate that key immediately via the Supabase dashboard.
# 2) Deleting files and committing does NOT remove them from git history â€” follow the repo-history purge steps in the project README or use git-filter-repo/BFG to scrub history.
