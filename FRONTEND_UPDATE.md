# Frontend Update - New Fields Integration

## Summary
Updated the Department 56 Gallery frontend to display and edit all new fields captured during the data migration. Forms are now compact and efficient, with year fields using minimal width.

## Changes Made

### 1. TypeScript Types Updated (`src/types/database.ts`)
- **House type**: Added `collection?: string` and `series?: string`
- **Accessory type**: Added `year?: number`, `collection?: string`, and `series?: string`
- Both types already had: `retired_year`, `description`, `sku`, `price`

### 2. House Form Enhanced (`src/DeptApp.tsx` - HouseForm component)

#### New State Variables
- `retiredYear` - Year the house was retired from production
- `price` - Purchase or retail price
- `collectionName` - Collection name from document
- `series` - Series name from document

#### Form Layout (Compact Design)
1. **House Name** - Full width input
2. **SKU & Price Row** (2 columns)
   - SKU/Item Number input
   - Price input (decimal, formatted as currency)
3. **Years Row** (4 columns, compact)
   - Released year
   - Retired year
   - Purchased year
   - *(4th column available for future use)*
4. **Collection & Series Row** (2 columns)
   - Collection input
   - Series input
5. **Photo** - File upload with thumbnail preview
6. **Description** - Text area (2 rows)
7. **Notes** - Text area
8. **Collections** - Multi-select chips
9. **Tags** - Multi-select chips

### 3. Accessory Form Enhanced (`src/DeptApp.tsx` - AccessoryForm component)

#### New State Variables
- `year` - Release year for accessories
- `retiredYear` - Year retired from production
- `price` - Purchase or retail price
- `collectionName` - Collection name from document
- `series` - Series name from document

#### Form Layout (Compact Design)
Same layout as House form:
1. Accessory Name (full width)
2. SKU & Price (2 columns)
3. Years: Released, Retired, Purchased (4 columns)
4. Collection & Series (2 columns)
5. Photo with thumbnail
6. Description (2 rows)
7. Notes
8. Collections chips
9. Tags chips

### 4. Display Cards Updated

#### HouseCard
Now displays:
- House name
- **SKU** (if present)
- **Price** in green (if present, formatted as $XX.XX)
- Year pills: Released, Retired, Purchased
- **Collection** and **Series** (if present)
- Linked collections (multi-select)
- Tags
- Accessory count

#### AccessoryCard
Now displays:
- Accessory name
- **SKU** (if present)
- **Price** in green (if present, formatted as $XX.XX)
- Year pills: Year, Retired, Purchased
- **Collection** and **Series** (if present)
- Linked collections (multi-select)
- Tags
- Linked houses

### 5. House Detail Modal Updated
The detail modal metadata section now shows:
- **SKU** (new field)
- **Price** (new field, formatted as $XX.XX in green)
- **Released** year
- **Retired** year (new field)
- **Purchased** year
- **Collection** (new field)
- **Series** (new field)
- SKU(s) from notes (legacy)
- **Description** (new field)

## Design Decisions

### Compact Year Fields
- Year inputs use `grid-cols-4` with compact width
- Labels are concise: "Released", "Retired", "Purchased"
- Full-width input avoided to save space
- Numeric inputs for years (4-digit expected)

### Price Display
- Displayed in green (#10b981) to stand out
- Formatted with 2 decimal places (`.toFixed(2)`)
- Input uses `type="number"` with `step="0.01"`
- Labeled as "Price ($)" to indicate currency

### Collection vs Collections
- **collection** (lowercase, string): Text field from document parser
- **Collections** (capitalized, multi-select): Many-to-many linked collections
- Both are displayed to preserve all data

### Form Organization
- Related fields grouped in rows (SKU+Price, Years, Collection+Series)
- Most important fields at top (Name, SKU, Price)
- Photo and text areas in middle
- Multi-select chips at bottom

## Data Coverage

Based on deployment statistics:
- **456 houses** in database
- **334 accessories** in database
- **332 houses with price** (72.8% coverage)
- Price range: $12.00 - $225.00
- Average price: $79.53

## Next Steps

### Filtering & Sorting
- [ ] Add price range filter
- [ ] Add collection filter (from text field)
- [ ] Add series filter
- [ ] Add retired year filter
- [ ] Sort by price
- [ ] Sort by year

### Dashboard
- [ ] Total collection value display
- [ ] Collection breakdown chart
- [ ] Year distribution timeline
- [ ] Price distribution histogram
- [ ] Items missing price data

### Data Quality
- [ ] Manual price entry for 124 houses without prices
- [ ] Manual image upload for 26 houses without images
- [ ] Manual image upload for 68 accessories without images

## Testing

✅ Application compiles successfully
✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3000/

## Files Modified

1. `src/types/database.ts` - Added collection, series, year to types
