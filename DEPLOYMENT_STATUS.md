# üö® Deployment Status Update

## Issue Encountered

After first deployment, site became unreachable including diagnostic page.

**Root Cause:** Build command in `vercel.json` used shell command `cp diagnostic.html dist/` which may have caused build failure.

## Fix Applied ‚úÖ

### Changes Made:
1. **Moved `diagnostic.html`** from root ‚Üí `public/` folder
   - Vite automatically copies public folder contents to dist
   - No shell commands needed
   
2. **Simplified `vercel.json`**
   - Removed: `"buildCommand": "npm run build && cp diagnostic.html dist/"`
   - Now uses: `"buildCommand": "npm run build"` (default)
   - Removed diagnostic route rewrite (no longer needed, file in public)

3. **Verified build locally** ‚úÖ
   - Build succeeds
   - diagnostic.html correctly included in dist/

### Git Commits:
- `4fa6c37` - Initial mobile fixes and layout changes
- `041051d` - Fix build issue (current)

## Current Deployment Status

**Commit:** `041051d` - Fix build: move diagnostic.html to public folder and simplify vercel.json

**Pushed:** Just now

**Expected:** Vercel should complete deployment in 2-3 minutes

## Testing Instructions

### Wait 3-5 Minutes
Vercel needs time to:
1. Detect new commit
2. Build application  
3. Deploy to production
4. Propagate to CDN

### Then Test:

#### 1. Desktop Chrome
```
https://dept56.rndpig.com
```
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
- Should load normally
- Browse buttons should be on FIRST row
- Filter fields on SECOND row

#### 2. Mobile Chrome  
```
https://dept56.rndpig.com
```
- Clear Chrome data for site first:
  - Settings ‚Üí Privacy ‚Üí Site Settings
  - Find dept56.rndpig.com
  - Clear & Reset
- Reload page
- Should load within 10-30 seconds

#### 3. Diagnostic Page
```
https://dept56.rndpig.com/diagnostic.html
```
Note: Must include `.html` extension now
- Run connection tests
- Should show all tests pass

### Mobile Cache Clearing:

**Chrome Mobile:**
1. Three dots ‚Üí Settings
2. Privacy and Security
3. Clear browsing data
4. Select "Cached images and files"
5. Time range: Last hour
6. Clear data

**Safari iOS:**
1. Settings ‚Üí Safari
2. Clear History and Website Data
3. Or long-press reload button ‚Üí "Request Desktop Site"

## What Changed vs Original Deployment

### Build Process:
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Custom shell command to copy file | Vite automatically includes public folder |
| Complex vercel.json rewrites | Simple default config |
| Potential build failure point | Reliable standard approach |

### File Structure:
```
Before:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ diagnostic.html (root)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vercel.json (complex build command)

After:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ public/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ diagnostic.html (auto-copied by Vite)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ vercel.json (simplified)
```

## Why This Should Work

1. **Standard Vite Pattern:** Using public folder is the recommended way
2. **No Shell Commands:** Removes potential failure point
3. **Verified Locally:** Build tested and confirmed working
4. **Simpler Config:** Less complexity = less chance of issues

## If Site Still Unreachable

### Option 1: Wait Longer
- Some deployments take 5-10 minutes
- Check Vercel dashboard for status

### Option 2: Check Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find dept56-gallery project
3. Check "Deployments" tab
4. Look for commit `041051d`
5. Check if "Building", "Ready", or "Error"

### Option 3: Rollback to Working Version
If needed, rollback to commit before our changes:
1. Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Deployments
2. Find deployment from commit `eab64f7` (before our changes)
3. Click "..." ‚Üí "Promote to Production"

This will restore the site immediately (without our fixes, but at least it will be up).

## Next Steps

1. ‚è∞ **Wait 3-5 minutes**
2. üßπ **Clear browser cache** on all devices
3. üß™ **Test on desktop** first
4. üì± **Test on mobile** after confirming desktop works
5. üì∏ **Screenshot** any errors if they occur

## Questions to Answer

- [ ] Is Vercel showing build success or error?
- [ ] Can you access the site on desktop at all?
- [ ] What error message do you see (if any)?
- [ ] Does hard refresh help?
- [ ] Does incognito mode work?

---

**Status:** Fix deployed, waiting for Vercel to build
**Time:** Should be ready by 7:00 PM
**Risk:** Low - using standard Vite pattern now
