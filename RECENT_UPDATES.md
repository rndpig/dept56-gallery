# Recent Feature Updates

## 1. SKU Field Addition

### Overview
Added a separate `sku` field to both houses and accessories, removing the need to store SKUs in the notes field.

### Changes Made

#### Database Schema
- **New SQL Migration**: `add_sku_field.sql`
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE houses ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sku TEXT;
  ALTER TABLE accessories ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS sku TEXT;
  ```
- **Action Required**: Run this migration in Supabase SQL Editor

#### Type Definitions (`src/types/database.ts`)
- Added `sku?: string` to both `House` and `Accessory` types
- Field is optional to support existing data

#### HouseForm Updates
- Added `sku` state variable
- Added SKU field to useEffect for reactive updates
- Included SKU in form submission object
- **UI**: New "SKU / Item Number" text input field
  - Positioned between Description and Notes
  - Placeholder: "e.g., 56.12345"
  - Single-line text input

#### AccessoryForm Updates
- Added `sku` state variable
- Added SKU field to useEffect for reactive updates  
- Included SKU in form submission object
- **UI**: New "SKU / Item Number" text input field
  - Positioned between Description and Notes
  - Placeholder: "e.g., 56.12345"
  - Single-line text input

#### Notes Field Update
- Updated placeholder from "Additional notes, SKUs, etc." to just "Additional notes"
- SKUs should now go in the dedicated SKU field

### Benefits
- **Cleaner Data**: SKUs have their own dedicated field
- **Better Searching**: Can search specifically by SKU
- **Consistent Format**: Enforces SKU entry in a standardized location
- **Migration Friendly**: Optional field means existing data isn't affected

## 2. Edit Button in House Detail Modal

### Overview
Added an "Edit" button to the house detail modal, allowing quick access to edit mode while browsing.

### Changes Made

#### HouseDetailModal Component
- Added `onEdit` callback prop: `(houseId: string) => void`
- **UI Update**: Header now has two buttons:
  ```
  [House Name]          [Edit] [Close]
  ```
- Edit button styling: Indigo background, white text
- Button triggers the edit handler with the house ID

#### Edit Handler Function
When the Edit button is clicked:
1. **Switch to Manage tab**: `setTab("manage")`
2. **Load house for editing**: `setEditHouseId(houseId)`
3. **Close modal**: `houseModal.hide()`

### User Workflow

**Before:**
1. Browse houses
2. Click on a house to view details
3. Close modal
4. Navigate to Manage tab
5. Find house in dropdown
6. Select it to edit

**After:**
1. Browse houses
2. Click on a house to view details
3. **Click "Edit" button**
4. ✅ Automatically switched to Manage tab with house loaded for editing
5. See linked accessories in right panel
6. Edit house and/or accessories

### Benefits
- **Faster Workflow**: 3 fewer steps to start editing
- **Contextual**: Edit what you're looking at
- **Intuitive**: Natural "view → edit" flow
- **Seamless**: Modal closes and Manage tab opens with data pre-loaded
- **Complete Access**: Once in edit mode, can also edit all linked accessories

### Technical Details
- Modal remains flexible - can be reused for read-only viewing
- Edit handler is passed as a prop, keeping concerns separated
- State updates trigger React re-renders, so UI updates automatically
- House form populates via existing useEffect mechanism

## Combined Workflow Example

### Scenario: User finds a house while browsing and wants to update its SKU

1. **Browse Tab**: User clicks on "Mickey's Stuffed Animals"
2. **Modal Opens**: Shows photos and details
3. **User Clicks "Edit"**: Button in modal header
4. **Manage Tab**: Automatically opens with house loaded
5. **Right Panel**: Shows linked accessories (e.g., "Stuffing Station")
6. **Form Fields**: User sees:
   - Description field (existing content)
   - **SKU field** ← enters "56.58418" here
   - Notes field (for additional info)
7. **Click "Update House"**: Saves changes
8. **Optionally**: Click "Edit" on a linked accessory to update it too
9. Complete entire editing session without tab switching

## Migration Checklist

### Required Steps
- [ ] Run `add_sku_field.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- [ ] Test SKU field in house creation
- [ ] Test SKU field in accessory creation  
- [ ] Test SKU field updates when editing

- [ ] Verify modal closes and Manage tab opens
- [ ] Confirm house loads correctly in edit form

### Data Migration (Optional)
If you have existing SKUs in the notes field, you may want to:
1. Export data with existing notes
2. Parse SKU values from notes
3. Update records to populate new SKU field
4. Clean up notes to remove extracted SKUs

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Optional SKU field - existing records work fine without it
