# Web Scraping Enhancement Plan for Department 56 Gallery

## Overview
Scrape department56.com and retiredproducts.department56.com to enhance existing metadata with official manufacturer data.

## Phase 1: Research & Prototyping (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Test if retired products site works with simple requests (BeautifulSoup)
- [ ] Identify URL patterns for product pages
- [ ] Map data fields available on product pages
- [ ] Test search functionality with sample SKUs from database
- [ ] Determine rate limiting needs (be respectful!)

## Phase 2: Build Scraper (2-3 hours)
- [ ] Create scraper script with retry logic
- [ ] Implement SKU/name matching against Supabase data
- [ ] Extract:
  - Multiple product images (URLs)
  - Official descriptions
  - Intro/retirement years (verify/correct existing data)
  - Original prices
  - Dimensions
  - Categories/collections
- [ ] Save results to JSON for review
- [ ] Add progress tracking and error handling

## Phase 3: Image Download & Upload (1-2 hours)
- [ ] Download additional product images
- [ ] Upload to Supabase Storage with naming convention
- [ ] Create image gallery structure in database

## Phase 4: Database Enhancement (1 hour)
- [ ] Update houses table with enhanced metadata
- [ ] Add fields: description, dimensions, original_price, category
- [ ] Create images table for multiple photos per item
- [ ] Update existing records with scraped data

## Phase 5: Quality Control (1 hour)
- [ ] Compare scraped data vs existing Word doc data
- [ ] Flag discrepancies for manual review
- [ ] Generate enhancement report
- [ ] Verify image quality and relevance

## Technical Stack Recommendation
**Primary:** Playwright (best balance of power/speed)
**Backup:** BeautifulSoup if site is simple HTML
**Storage:** Continue using Supabase Storage
**Matching:** Use SKU numbers from Word docs as primary key

## Ethical Considerations
- ✅ Respect robots.txt
- ✅ Add delays between requests (1-2 seconds)
- ✅ Use descriptive User-Agent
- ✅ Cache results to avoid re-scraping
- ✅ Run during off-peak hours
- ✅ This is for personal use, not commercial redistribution

## Expected Outcomes
- 📸 2-4 images per house (vs current 1)
- 📝 Official descriptions (more accurate than Word doc notes)
- 📅 Verified intro/retirement dates
- 💰 Historical pricing data
- 📏 Product dimensions
- 🎨 Collection/category tags

## Estimated Timeline
- Total: 6-9 hours of development
- Scraping runtime: 2-3 hours (456 products × 2-4 sec/product)

## Risk Mitigation
- Save progress frequently (resume capability)
- Don't modify database until scraping is complete
- Keep original data for comparison
- Manual review before bulk updates

## Next Steps
1. Create prototype scraper for 5-10 items
2. Validate data quality
3. Get your approval before full scrape
4. Run full scrape with progress monitoring
5. Review results and enhance database
