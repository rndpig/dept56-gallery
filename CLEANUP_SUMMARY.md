## 🗂️ Organization Improvements

### New Structure
Created `scripts/` directory with organized subdirectories:

```
scripts/
├── data-ingestion/     # Word document import tools
│   ├── ingest_docx.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── scraping/           # Web scraping utilities
│   ├── scraper_prototype.py
│   └── requirements.txt
├── maintenance/        # Database maintenance
│   ├── analyze_duplicates.py (renamed from v3)
│   ├── generate_cleanup_plan.py
│   └── execute_cleanup.py
└── README.md          # Comprehensive usage guide
```

### Documentation Added
- **scripts/README.md** - Complete guide for all utility scripts
- **CLEANUP_PLAN.md** - Detailed cleanup rationale and execution plan
- **CODE_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Actionable improvement recommendations
- Updated main README.md with new structure

---

## 🎯 What Was Kept

### Production Code (Untouched)
- ✅ `src/` - Complete React/TypeScript application
- ✅ `supabase-schema.sql` - Database schema
- ✅ Configuration files (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind, etc.)
- ✅ Documentation (README.md, QUICKSTART.md, INGESTION_GUIDE.md, etc.)

### Active Utilities (Organized)
- ✅ Data ingestion from Word documents
- ✅ Web scraping tools
- ✅ Duplicate detection and cleanup tools

---

## 💡 Code Improvement Recommendations

Created comprehensive improvement plan with priorities:

### High Priority
1. **ESLint & Prettier** - Code quality and consistency
2. **Error Boundaries** - Graceful error handling
3. **Loading States** - Better UX
4. **Input Validation** - Data integrity

### Medium Priority
5. **Unit Tests** - Code reliability
6. **Virtual Scrolling** - Performance optimization
7. **Image Lazy Loading** - Faster page loads
8. **Accessibility** - Inclusive design

### Low Priority
9. **E2E Tests** - Complete workflow testing
10. **Service Worker** - Offline support
11. **Bundle Optimization** - Load time improvements
12. **Pre-commit Hooks** - Development workflow

### Architecture Suggestions
- Split 1,238-line `DeptApp.tsx` into smaller components
- Extract custom hooks for reusable logic
- Consider state management (Zustand/Context)
- Add performance monitoring
